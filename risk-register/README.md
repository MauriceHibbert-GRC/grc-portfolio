# Mini Risk Register â€” Healthcare Clinic

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- IT risk identification & documentation  
- Likelihood/impact scoring using a 5Ã—5 matrix  
- Creating visual risk heat maps for management reporting  
- Translating technical risk data into plain-English executive summaries

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project is a mock risk assessment for a small healthcare clinic in Kingston that uses an online patient-record system hosted in the cloud.  

The objective was to identify key assets, evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities, assign risk scores, and recommend practical controls.  
The final deliverables are presented in both technical (CSV, heat map) and non-technical (executive summary) formats.

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Asset identification** â€“ patient database, clinic Wi-Fi, cloud storage, staff laptops, patient portal.  
2. **Threat & vulnerability mapping** â€“ examples include weak password policy, unencrypted Wi-Fi, and no backup policy.  
3. **Scoring** â€“ assigned Impact and Likelihood on a scale of 1â€“5, calculated Risk Score = Impact Ã— Likelihood.  
4. **Prioritization** â€“ risks sorted by highest scores to identify immediate priorities.  
5. **Control recommendations** â€“ MFA, WPA3 encryption, automated backups, phishing awareness training.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- [Executive Summary](executive_summary.md) â€” Plain-English overview for management.
- [Risk Register (CSV)](risk_register.csv) â€” Full list of risks, scores, and recommended controls.
- [Risk Heat Map (PNG)](heatmap.png) â€” Visual representation of risk levels.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- High-scoring risks (e.g., unauthorized access to patient database) require immediate attention through strong access controls and MFA.  
- Even low-likelihood risks (e.g., no backup policy) can have critical impact and must be addressed.  
- Visual tools like heat maps improve stakeholder understanding of risk priorities.
