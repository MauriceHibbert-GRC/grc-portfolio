# Mini Risk Register – Healthcare Clinic Example

This is a mock project to demonstrate risk assessment skills for a GRC role.

## Scenario
A small healthcare clinic in Kingston uses an online patient-records system hosted in the cloud. I identified key assets, possible threats, and vulnerabilities, then scored risks using a 5x5 matrix. Finally, I recommended controls to reduce high-priority risks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Identifying and documenting IT risks
- Using likelihood/impact scoring
- Creating executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders
- Presenting findings in both technical (CSV) and visual (heat map) formats

## How to View This Project
To get the most out of this example project:
1. **Start with `executive_summary.md`** – quick, plain-English overview of top risks and recommendations.
2. **Open `risk_register.csv`** – detailed list of risks, vulnerabilities, scores, and recommended controls.
3. **View `heatmap.png`** – visual 5x5 risk matrix showing where each risk falls.

## Files
- `risk_register.csv` – The full table of risks and recommended controls
- `heatmap.png` – Visual risk heat map
- `executive_summary.md` – Top risks explained for management
