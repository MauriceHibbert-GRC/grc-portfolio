# Executive Summary – Mini Risk Register (Healthcare Clinic)

**Purpose:**  
This assessment identifies and prioritizes key IT risks for a small healthcare clinic using an online patient-records system hosted in the cloud.

**Top 3 Risks:**
1. **Unauthorized access to patient database** – High likelihood and critical impact due to weak password policy.  
2. **Unencrypted clinic Wi-Fi** – Medium likelihood with high impact if intercepted.  
3. **No backup policy for cloud storage** – Low likelihood but very high impact if data is lost.

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password rules.
- Encrypt clinic Wi-Fi and segment guest networks.
Implement daily automated backups with secure offsite storage, and establish a supporting policy statement.

**Impact:**  
Reducing these risks will protect patient privacy, improve compliance readiness, and lower the chance of costly data breaches.
