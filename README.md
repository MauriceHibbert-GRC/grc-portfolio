## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
Iâ€™m Maurice Hibbert, a CISA-passed early-career **IT Auditor / Risk Analyst** based in Jamaica. My focus is on turning governance, risk, and compliance principles into **clear, actionable deliverables** â€” from risk registers and control tests to executive-ready summaries.  

I built this portfolio to demonstrate the same structured, detail-oriented work I would bring to an entry-level audit or risk role, while showing how I communicate findings for both technical and non-technical audiences.
